## Features

* We have preemptively added login and contact pages ahead of capital investment.  The login page would allow Subscribers access to a paid area with additional features.  

## Further Development

In the conception phase of development, we had an additional User story that we later omitted because of time constraints.  
* User Story: As a consumer, I want to search for coupons according to store name so that I can save money at a given store.
For further development, one feature that could be added that would address this user story is a button/script to search directly by store name from the outset rather than location.  


## Challenges

We faced mostly challenges with keeping our local branches in-sync through timely merging on github.  Just when we felt we had nailed down a good SOP for pushing/pulling, and merging, we would run into unexpected errors.  Eventually, our workflow became fairly straighforward and well co-ordinated.  Working with the new framework, Foundation, was easy enough; it works very similarly to Bootstrap. However, the premade structures for gridding were at first a bit odd looking--the grid classes seemed a bit redundant/overlapping.
