## Description 

A simple web app to retrieve data about coupons offered by chain stores in the chosen location.
[https://callingrapher.github.io/ProjectTheFirst/]


* The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future. A good README helps you stand out among the large crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub.  What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? 


* If you need an example of a good README, check out [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).
